This is a repository that will allow us to test the performance of our react components. 

Much of this is done by using the perfomance.now() method in conjunction with React's Lifecycle methods to measure: 

1. Rerenders
2. TTP


We also want to add the ability to measure external metrics like:
1. Bundle size
